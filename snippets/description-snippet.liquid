    Short and wide compared to the average wakesurf board, the Hypsta is a compact powerhouse. 
    The Hypsta’s full width carries down to a squared swallowtail making it fast, stable and maneuverable. The Phase Five Hypsta Wakesurfer is a short board that can spin easily. 
    If you are a large rider, don’t let the Hypsta’s short length make you think it wont stay in the wave. This bad boy carries tons of momentum and effortlessly remains in the sweet spot. 
    The Phase Five Hypsta Wakesurfer is in a league of its own. The Hypsta is built using our Carbon Innegra Vertical (CI-V) weave material, and a three fin setup loaded with our 2” Skim Fin in the center accompanied by 1” Fakie Skim fins on the outside.

    Drew Danielo wanted more pop and speed, and that is exactly what we created with the Phase Five Diamond Turbo Wakesurfer. 
    We enhanced the original Diamond tail shape with a wider, more boxed out design. This upgraded design feature delivers experienced riders the opportunity to go big. 
    The Turbo tail design is also the solution for large riders who need more push and surfers using smaller, less powerful waves. 
    The Diamond Turbo is built using our unique Carbon Innegra Vertical (CI-V) weave material for ultimate strength. 
    We configured the Diamond Turbo with a three fin setup installed with our 2” Skim Fin in the center accompanied by 1” Fakie Skim fins on the outside.

    The Diamond has been an icon in the P5 line for many years now.  In recent years, the Diamond Turbo came to fruition and is well received. 
    The Turbo was added to the name after we enhanced the Diamond tail shape with a more boxed out design giving the rider more volume under the rear foot. 
    More volume adds bigger pop and ability to gain more speed without having to be super heavy on your front foot. 
    The Diamond is made GatorSkin that makes it ultra-strong while maintaining light weight for performance. 
    The Diamond Turbo is equipped with a versatile tri-fin skim setup that can be configured to suit riders of all levels.

    The Phase Five Hammerhead Wakesurfer is king of revert. With a square nose and tail design, the Hammerhead delivers tons of speed and stability in both directions. 
    Drew Danielo discovered that a traditional pulled in nose would struggle to ride backwards. 
    This is where the Hammerhead triumphs. In addition, the peanut side rail design creates two contact points on the wave instead of one. 
    This keeps the Hammerhead locked in and pointed down the line. The peanut outline adds surface area under each foot for increased maneuverability and speed than its predecessor. 
    The Phase Five Hammerhead is built with P5’s Gatorskin material and a single fin setup loaded with our 1” Skim Fin.

    The freshly re-designed Phantom is Parker Payne’s most dialed in surfboard yet. 
    The 2023 Phantom features an updated nose design that carries more speed and momentum through tricks while riding revert. 
    The updated shape retains the characteristics of the original design while enabling Parker to ride more aggressively than before. 
    His technical riding requires a fast, versatile board and we achieved this with a nice parallel outline combined with the perfect amount of rocker and concave on the bottom. 
    These design features generate tons of pop and deliver the platform to help your surf style skills progress without limits. 
    It is built with our brand new Flightlite V2 Pro Select layup for ultimate lightweight performance and FCS Fusion fin plugs in a quad setup.

    The Phantom designed by Parker Payne has quickly become one of the most popular surf models in the lineup. 
    Parker’s technical riding requires a fast and versatile board which the Phantom delivers. 
    With it’s nice parallel outline, the Phantom is super fast and generates a lot of pop.  
    The wider nose lets the board maintain speed when the board is in the revert position. 
    An analogy we often like to use for feel of the Phantom is that it is similar to that of skateboard. 
    The Phantom is built with Phase Five's FLEXtec V2 glass system. FLEXtec V2 gives the feeling of a traditional surfboard while delivering wake surf specific features. 
    It comes with a Quad fin FCS surf fin setup.

    The extended rounded nose allows the rider to gain more range in carves from the top to the bottom of the wave.

  <p><strong>REDESIGNED FOIL BOARD</strong></p>  
</div>
<div class="copy-info">
  <p>
    The Gadget is freshly redesigned for 2023. We collaborated with foil expert John Akerman to develop an exciting new foil-specific board. 
    He requested a light-weight, minimalistic deck to execute a variety of airs and flips he’s working on and we nailed it. 
    The thin skim style construction sinks under the water nicely, making it easier than a buoyant surf style board to situate before getting pulled up. 
    The coffin outline offers forgiveness while the wide squash tail provides extra stability and control. 
    The improved angled front foot strap delivers a natural comfortable feel for your stance rather than the previous straight vertical configuration. 
    It is built with our high end skimboard construction using Carbon Innegra Vertical (CI-V) weave and epoxy resin for superior strength. 
    The Gadget features an adjustable 10.75” long track mount for the foil.

</div>
<div class="copy-info">
  <p>
    The Gadget is the first skim style hybrid foil board that Phase Five has designed. 
    The advantages to the Skim Style foil design is that it easier to control the board under your feet when you take off. 
    The Gadget comes equipped with optional foot straps for aggressive riding, or as a training assist for first time foilers. 
    We made sure when designing the Gadget that it was made super strong so that it would be able to handle whatever you are ready to throw at it. 
    The thinner skim style core allows the Gadget to be super maneuverable and nimble feeling to the foil rider. 
    The Gadget utilizes the track mount system on the bottom. This allows experienced foil riders to mount any foil they choose, while being able to micro adjust it for their own setup. 
    Get a taste of flying with the use of a hydrofoil underneath your feet, and reset your mind as to what is possible behind the boat. 
    What is even more neat is that the Gadget can be used as a wakesurfer as well. 
    The board comes with twin fin skim style setup to try out once you’re done with your foil session. 
    The Gadget comes in 54” and features a wide outline that will support a wide range of riders. 
    The complete Gadget Board + Foil package comes with the Phase Five Nova Foil. 
    The Phase Five Nova Foil is equipped with a longer 28" mast for more room to fly and pump, something seasoned foilers will appreciate.

    The Design of the Shrimp is a traditional skim style board to keep the board very maneuverable and easy to control for the kids just beginning their quest to drop the rope. 
    Its skim style core makes it easy for kids to sink the board under their feet at start up and will allow them to get up with no problem.

    We worked with John Akerman to develop an "ocean style” surfboard for behind the boat. 
    The Ahi is the result. To start, we will begin at the tail- the swallow tail shape gives the board the drive to lift and snap in critical spots on the lip. 
    The overall outline releases like a charm when you want it to and provides the control you need at every moment. 
    The Ahi is built with Phase Five's FLEXtec V2 glass system. FLEXtec V2 gives the feeling of a traditional surfboard while delivering wake surf specific features. 
    It comes with a Quad fin FCS surf fin setup.

    Big Guy Alert! Don’t be left behind… (the boat ). You have asked for a remedy for the “lost my wave performance blues”, so we called up the Doctor. 
    His script calls for a massive dose of planing surface with a fast, trim rail line and Quad fin FCS surf fin set up delivered in a FLEXTec V2 glass shell. 
    Ample nose rocker to keep her on top, a clean single concave to charge down the line and gentle tail kick make the Doctor fast, stable and forgiving with plenty of maneuverability. 
    A painless cure for the sluggish blues, the Doctor is a great addition to any quiver!

    If you can't decide on surf or skim style, why not have have both? 
    The Fireball is back in the P5 Lineup for 2022 after many requests for the Hybrid style wakesurf board to return. 
    It features the Matrix outline with a surf style EPS core and built with our FLEXtec V2 construction. 
    It is designed to be rode with either Twin FCS surf fins, or a single DT1 Skim style fin.  
    The Fireball has reduced volume and rocker than your traditional surfboard enhancing responsiveness and speed.  
    If you want the loose skim feel, install the DT1 fin in the rear FCS box to crank some shuv’s.  
    Once you are ready to slash and boost airs, remove the skim fin and install the twin FCS surf fins in the forward fin boxes.  
    The Fireball is one of the most versatile boards in the lineup, and does a great job introducing the rider into both disciplines of wake surfing with one single board.
