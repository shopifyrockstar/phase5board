    The Diamond has been an icon in the P5 line for many years now.  In recent years, the Diamond Turbo came to fruition and is well received. 
    The Turbo was added to the name after we enhanced the Diamond tail shape with a more boxed out design giving the rider more volume under the rear foot. 
    More volume adds bigger pop and ability to gain more speed without having to be super heavy on your front foot. 
    The Diamond is made GatorSkin that makes it ultra-strong while maintaining light weight for performance. 
    The Diamond Turbo is equipped with a versatile tri-fin skim setup that can be configured to suit riders of all levels.

    For 2022, John Akerman decided he wanted to change the tail because he was looking for more speed and traction for big maneuvers. 
    The “Moon” tail delivers those needs. The overall shape from the tail up didn’t change at all which keeps the boards high performance and forgiveness aspects in check.

    The Phantom designed by Parker Payne has quickly become one of the most popular surf models in the lineup. 
    Parker’s technical riding requires a fast and versatile board which the Phantom delivers. 
    With it’s nice parallel outline, the Phantom is super fast and generates a lot of pop.  
    The wider nose lets the board maintain speed when the board is in the revert position. 
    An analogy we often like to use for feel of the Phantom is that it is similar to that of skateboard. 
    The Phantom is built with Phase Five's FLEXtec V2 glass system. FLEXtec V2 gives the feeling of a traditional surfboard while delivering wake surf specific features. 
    It comes with a Quad fin FCS surf fin setup.

    The Swell designed by Stacia Bank has been a staple in the line for many years. It offers a leaner outline, pulled in nose and a super poppy tail. 
    The more parallel rails increase the down the line speed, while the wide tail gives you tons of boost off the wave and helps you spin those smooth 360’s. 
    The pulled in nose lets you charge the lip with speed and power. The Swell is built with Phase Five's FLEXtec V2 glass system. 
    FLEXtec V2 gives the feeling of a traditional surfboard while delivering wake surf specific features. It comes with a Quad fin FCS surf fin setup.

    There is a new board in town and it isn’t your average superhero. Phase 5 went to work on creating a unique board to satisfy the cravings of those desiring an ocean surfing feel behind the boat. 
    The Venom was designed for aggressive pumping, deep bottom turns, and monstrous pop while retaining the agility of modern competitive wake surfboards. 
    The tapered blunt nose will attach the most vertical wave with ease and provide ample stability when landing revert. 
    The hybrid bat tail design generates tremendous carving control with a relaxed release while still supplying plenty of push in the back of the wave. 
    The Venom is built with Phase Five's FLEXtec V2 glass system. FLEXtec V2 gives the feeling of a traditional surfboard while delivering wake surf specific features. 
    It comes with a Twin fin FCS surf fin setup to keep the board loose and lively. This board is built for shredding.

    The Asym is new on the scene and is derived from ocean “asymmetrical” surfboard designs for riding point break style waves. 
    Wakesurfing is essentially the same as riding a point break wave. The rider is constantly on a comparable ocean “left” or “right”. 
    In case of wakesurfing behind a boat, we call is “Port” or “Starboard”. The concept is simple. 
    A wake surfboard designed specifically for riding one side of the boat to gain performance a traditional symmetrical shape can’t. 
    The design features a longer rail for quick response and speed back into the wave. The rounded portion of the tail allows for powerful carves and blows off the top of the wave. 
    Re-entry recovery from aerial maneuvers and tricks is accelerated by the unique asymmetrical shape. 
    The extended rounded nose allows the rider to gain more range in carves from the top to the bottom of the wave. 
    Overall, we have found that the Asym’s have more drive than your traditional surf style board and offer more speed when setting up for your tricks.

    The Gadget is the first skim style hybrid foil board that Phase Five has designed.

    The Gadget comes equipped with optional foot straps for aggressive riding, or as a training assist for first time foilers. 
    We made sure when designing the Gadget that it was made super strong so that it would be able to handle whatever you are ready to throw at it. 
    The thinner skim style core allows the Gadget to be super maneuverable and nimble feeling to the foil rider. 
    The Gadget utilizes the track mount system on the bottom. This allows experienced foil riders to mount any foil they choose, while being able to micro adjust it for their own setup. 
    Get a taste of flying with the use of a hydrofoil underneath your feet, and reset your mind as to what is possible behind the boat. 
    What is even more neat is that the Gadget can be used as a wakesurfer as well. 
    The board comes with twin fin skim style setup to try out once you’re done with your foil session. 
    The Gadget comes in 54” and features a wide outline that will support a wide range of riders. 
    The complete Gadget Board + Foil package comes with the Phase Five Nova Foil.

    We worked with John Akerman to develop an "ocean style” surfboard for behind the boat. 
    The Ahi is the result. To start, we will begin at the tail- the swallow tail shape gives the board the drive to lift and snap in critical spots on the lip. 
    The overall outline releases like a charm when you want it to and provides the control you need at every moment. 
    The Ahi is built with Phase Five's FLEXtec V2 glass system. FLEXtec V2 gives the feeling of a traditional surfboard while delivering wake surf specific features.

    If you can't decide on surf or skim style, why not have have both? 
    The Fireball is back in the P5 Lineup for 2022 after many requests for the Hybrid style wakesurf board to return. 
    It features the Matrix outline with a surf style EPS core and built with our FLEXtec V2 construction. 
    It is designed to be rode with either Twin FCS surf fins, or a single DT1 Skim style fin.  
    The Fireball has reduced volume and rocker than your traditional surfboard enhancing responsiveness and speed.  
    If you want the loose skim feel, install the DT1 fin in the rear FCS box to crank some shuv’s.  
    Once you are ready to slash and boost airs, remove the skim fin and install the twin FCS surf fins in the forward fin boxes.  
    The Fireball is one of the most versatile boards in the lineup, and does a great job introducing the rider into both disciplines of wake surfing with one single board.
